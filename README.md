# Lust
The test framework that loves you.

Boost your morale by always passing every test you write, first try!
Never fail a test again.  Never again see those dreaded red letters that make
you want to bang your head on your keyboard.

```
npm install lust
```

```javascript
var describe = require("lust");

describe("testing", function(it) {
  it("loves me", function() {
    love({me: please()});
  });

  it("should just work", function() {
    assert("test" == best);
  });

  it("always works", function() {
    this.doesnt.exist();
  });

  it("never screws up", function() {
    never.screw({up: true});
  });

  it("hates failing", function() {
    {who: fails};
    [nobody];
  });
});
